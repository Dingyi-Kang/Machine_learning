## Part 1

This error message is telling you that you've run out of GPU memory, which is also referred to as an Out of Memory (OOM) error. This happens when the tensors you're trying to allocate for your computations don't fit into the GPU memory.

The error message includes a log from TensorFlow's Best-fit with coalescing (BFC) allocator. This is a memory allocator for the GPU that TensorFlow uses. The BFC allocator tries to keep track of all the memory regions that have been allocated and deallocated over time to minimize the overall memory footprint.

The numbers and 'Chunks of size' parts are showing you how memory is allocated in the GPU. Each chunk is a contiguous piece of memory that's been allocated. For instance, '2 Chunks of size 1156055040 totalling 4.31GiB' means there are two allocated memory chunks, each of size around 1.08GiB, with a total of 4.31GiB. 

'InUse' shows the total memory currently being used, 'MaxInUse' shows the maximum memory used at any point, and 'Limit' shows the total memory available.

Finally, the error 'OOM when allocating tensor with shape[180,64,224,224]' indicates that the operation which caused the issue was trying to allocate a tensor of the given shape but there wasn't enough memory available. 

Possible solutions to this problem can be:

1. Decreasing your batch size to reduce memory consumption (you have already done this).
2. If your model architecture allows, you can try to reduce the complexity of your model.
3. Using a more memory-efficient variant of your model if available.
4. Try to utilize mixed precision training.
5. If available, use a GPU with more memory.

Remember that deep learning models especially with high-resolution input like (224,224,3) can be very memory-demanding and sometimes it's hard to fit them into the GPU memory.

## Part 2

Deep learning models, especially during training, often exhibit increased memory usage over time due to various reasons. Here are a few possible explanations for why you're observing this behavior:

1. **Caching:** TensorFlow may be caching intermediate computations for backpropagation. While this speeds up the computations, it can also increase memory usage. If your model has many layers or the computations are complex, this caching can end up taking significant space.

2. **Memory leaks:** If you're creating new TensorFlow operations, variables or graphs inside a loop, these can accumulate over time and lead to increased memory usage. Make sure that any computation that gets repeatedly executed is not leading to an increase in memory usage over time.

3. **Data accumulation:** If you're storing a lot of data in memory, for instance, the outputs of your model for each batch, this can increase memory usage over time. Try to minimize the amount of data you're storing in memory.

4. **Model complexity:** More complex models require more memory for both their parameters and the intermediate computations during training. As the training advances, the increase in model complexity and the accumulation of gradients can result in escalating memory usage.

One possible way to mitigate this issue could be to use TensorFlow's `tf.function` decorator on your training loop. This decorator compiles your computation into a static graph, which can be more memory-efficient and faster than executing operations one-by-one. Another option is to experiment with the `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` setting, which tries to allocate only as much GPU memory as needed for the runtime allocations and releases it when no longer needed.

However, please be aware that these are general tips and it's hard to give a precise solution without seeing the full code and understanding the complete context.

## Part 3 -- acculation of gradients????

In deep learning, GPU memory is allocated to store model weights, feature maps, gradients, and other data structures needed for training and inference. If the model and its required resources are too large to fit into GPU memory, you will encounter an Out of Memory (OOM) error.

This may happen for a number of reasons, and it doesn't necessarily relate to the number of episodes:

1. **Model size**: The model itself might be too large. This could be the case if you are using a very deep model or if the dimensions of your layers are too large.

2. **Batch size**: Larger batch sizes require more GPU memory because they need to store the gradients and feature maps for more examples simultaneously. You mentioned that reducing the batch size allowed you to run more episodes, which supports this point.

3. **Memory leaks**: In some cases, the GPU memory isn't properly freed after it's used, causing memory leaks. This could occur due to certain operations in TensorFlow or other libraries, or it could be due to bugs in your code.

4. **Accumulation of gradients**: In your provided code, you are accumulating gradients over the mini-batches. This process also requires more GPU memory.

It's important to understand that the memory is not just being used for the current forward and backward pass, but also for storing the computational graph, intermediate activations and gradients for the backpropagation, which can consume a significant amount of memory.

You have several options to deal with this:

- Continue to reduce your batch size until the model fits in memory.
- Use gradient checkpointing to reduce the memory needed for storing the intermediate activations at the cost of recomputing them during the backward pass.
- Check for memory leaks in your code, i.e., ensure tensors are being garbage collected as expected.
- If possible, use a GPU with more memory.
- Simplify your model architecture if it's too complex or large.
- Use mixed precision training, which can reduce memory usage by storing certain numbers in lower precision. 

## Part 4 - how to avoid the memory leaks? how to make sure GPU memory is properly freed after it's used?

Avoiding memory leaks, especially when dealing with TensorFlow and GPUs, can be a tricky task due to the complex nature of GPU memory management and TensorFlow's own behavior. However, here are a few general tips:

1. **Use TensorFlow's built-in functions whenever possible**: TensorFlow's built-in functions and layers are designed to properly manage GPU memory and should free any memory they use once it's no longer needed.

2. **Watch out for TensorFlow variables**: TensorFlow variables remain in memory until the session they were created in is closed. This can be a source of memory leaks if you create a lot of variables. If you're done with a variable and want to clear it from memory, you might have to manually delete it using `del` keyword and then clear the TensorFlow session.

3. **Avoid global variables**: Global variables can be another source of memory leaks, as they remain in memory for as long as the Python process is running. Try to keep the scope of your variables as narrow as possible.

4. **Make use of Python's garbage collection**: Python's garbage collector should automatically clean up objects that are no longer in use. However, if you have circular references (i.e., Object A references Object B and Object B references Object A), Pythonâ€™s garbage collector may not be able to free the memory. In these cases, you should manually break the circular references.

5. **Explicitly clear GPU memory**: In some cases, you may need to manually clear the GPU memory. For example, if you're using CUDA, you can use the command `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` to clear the memory cache. For TensorFlow, if you want to release all GPU memory, you may need to use `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()`. However, use these carefully, as improper use can lead to reduced performance.

6. **Proper session handling**: If you're using TensorFlow 1.x and sessions, make sure to close the session after you're done with it to free the resources.

7. **Watch out for TensorFlow's memory growth setting**: By default, TensorFlow maps nearly all of the GPU memory of all GPUs (subject to CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES) visible to the process which can result in TensorFlow memory errors if the memory isn't managed correctly. If you have this issue, you can tell TensorFlow to only allocate as much GPU memory as needed for its computations, rather than all of the GPU memory, using the following code:

```python
physical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if len(physical_devices) > 0:
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
```

Note: These are general tips and may not solve all memory leak problems. The source of a memory leak can sometimes be difficult to locate and may require careful debugging and understanding of how your code uses memory.


## part 5 -- will tf.keras.backend.clear_session() work for tensorflow 2?

Yes, the `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` function can be used in TensorFlow 2. It is used to clear any internal variables that TensorFlow might be holding onto and can help reset the state of the underlying session.

The function is often used when creating multiple models in a loop to ensure that there are no references to old models that can lead to out of memory errors.

Here's how you can use it:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

# ...some code to create a model...

# when you are done with the model
K.clear_session()
```

This will free up some memory, but it might not be significant if your models are large or your dataset is large. For GPU memory management in particular, it is often controlled directly by TensorFlow and the GPU itself, so while `clear_session()` can help, it may not solve all out-of-memory issues. For GPU memory, strategies like the ones I described in the previous message (like adjusting your mini-batch size, using gradient checkpointing, etc.) might be more effective.
