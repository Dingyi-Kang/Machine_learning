previously, we optimize different models and then test and compare them on seperate validation set. And we use tech like cross validation to maximally make use of the available data

### As the model selection based on bayesian principle, we reply the rule of probability to do selection without the need of independent test set. We will compare model by model evidence (which tends to select models that are just complex enough to model the data but not overly complex and thus avoid overfitting)

#### p(M) prior belief about model
