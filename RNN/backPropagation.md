To compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the hidden states at a certain time step in an RNN, you need to apply the chain rule of calculus during the backpropagation through time (BPTT) process. Here's a high-level overview of the steps:

1. Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output at the given time step. This depends on the specific loss function used (e.g., mean squared error or cross-entropy) and the difference between the predicted output and the target value.

2. Compute the gradient of the output at the given time step with respect to the hidden state. This typically involves differentiating the output function, which maps the hidden state to the output (e.g., using a linear layer followed by a softmax or sigmoid activation).

3. Apply the chain rule to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the hidden state at the given time step. This is done by multiplying the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output (from step 1) by the gradient of the output with respect to the hidden state (from step 2).

4. Propagate the gradients further back in time by computing the gradient of the hidden state at the previous time step. This involves differentiating the recurrent function, which maps the previous hidden state and input to the current hidden state (e.g., using a linear layer followed by a tanh or LSTM/GRU activation).

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all preceding time steps, moving backward through the computational graph.

By computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the hidden states at each time step, you can then update the model's parameters using gradient-based optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent or its variants.

Note that the specific equations for computing the gradients depend on the architecture of the RNN (e.g., vanilla RNN, LSTM, or GRU) and the choice of activation functions, as well as the loss function used.

## Why we need propagate the gradients further back in time? why we need to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the hidden state at the previous timestamp?

We need to propagate the gradients further back in time and compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the hidden states at previous timestamps because the goal of training an RNN is to learn the optimal set of parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the loss function. The learning process involves updating these parameters using the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters themselves.

In RNNs, the hidden states at each timestamp depend on the hidden states at previous timestamps, and these dependencies are captured through the recurrent connections (weights and biases). As a result, the loss function depends not only on the current hidden state but also on the previous hidden states.

By computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the hidden state at each timestamp, we can capture the contribution of each hidden state to the overall loss. 
### Propagating these gradients backward through time allows us to account for the dependencies between the hidden states and to determine how much each parameter should be adjusted to minimize the loss.

By updating the model parameters using the gradients computed through backpropagation, we can improve the RNN's ability to model the relationships between inputs and outputs over time. This is crucial for tasks such as sequence-to-sequence prediction, language modeling, and many other applications where the temporal dependencies between inputs and outputs are essential for accurate modeling.

In summary, we need to propagate the gradients further back in time and compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the hidden states at previous timestamps because this enables us to accurately capture the temporal dependencies in the data and to learn the optimal set of parameters for the RNN.

## we can express dL/dW_hh either in h_(t-1), or h_(t-2),.... or h_0. What are the difference?
Computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight matrix `W_hh` involves taking into account the contribution of each hidden state in the sequence to the overall loss. Each expression of `dL/dW_hh` with respect to a different hidden state (`h_(t-1)`, `h_(t-2)`, ..., or `h_0`) represents the influence of the corresponding hidden state on the loss function through the recurrent connections.

The differences between these expressions lie in the extent to which each hidden state contributes to the overall loss. In an RNN, hidden states closer to the current timestamp usually have a stronger influence on the loss function, as they directly impact the predictions at recent time steps. On the other hand, hidden states farther back in time have a weaker influence on the loss function, as their impact is progressively diluted through the recurrent connections.

When computing the total gradient of the loss function with respect to `W_hh`, it's essential to sum the gradients from all hidden states in the sequence. This will capture the combined influence of all hidden states on the overall loss:

`dL/dW_hh_total = Σ(dL/dW_hh_t)`, where the sum runs over all time steps `t`.

Each term `dL/dW_hh_t` represents the gradient of the loss function with respect to `W_hh` when considering the hidden state `h_t`. By summing these gradients, we account for the contributions of all hidden states, capturing the temporal dependencies in the data and allowing the RNN to learn the optimal set of parameters.

However, as mentioned earlier, backpropagating the gradients through time can be computationally expensive and suffer from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, especially when dealing with long sequences. To address these issues, various techniques such as truncated backpropagation through time, LSTMs, GRUs, or attention mechanisms have been developed to better capture long-term dependencies and make the training process more efficient.

## as for calculating dL/dW_hh_total, do we need to mean the sum of the gradients from all hidden states in the sequence?
When calculating the total gradient of the loss function with respect to W_hh, you should sum the gradients from all hidden states in the sequence, not average them. The total gradient dL/dW_hh_total is computed as follows:

dL/dW_hh_total = Σ(dL/dW_hh_t), where the sum runs over all time steps t.

Each term dL/dW_hh_t represents the gradient of the loss function with respect to W_hh when considering the hidden state h_t. By summing these gradients, you account for the contributions of all hidden states, capturing the temporal dependencies in the data, and allowing the RNN to learn the optimal set of parameters.

dL/dW_hh_avg = (1/N) * Σ(dL/dW_hh_t), where the sum runs over all time steps t, and N is the number of hidden states involved in the sequence.

### By averaging the gradients, you essentially normalize the contribution of each hidden state to the overall gradient update. However, keep in mind that this approach may diminish the influence of particularly significant hidden states on the parameter updates.

In practice, summing the gradients from all hidden states is more common when training RNNs. The learning rate in the optimization algorithm will control the magnitude of the weight updates, balancing the influence of the gradients from different time steps. However, if you choose to average the gradients, you should experiment with different learning rates to find the one that gives the best results for your specific task.
