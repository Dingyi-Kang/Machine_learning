Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions in a dynamic environment. The goal of an RL agent is to learn an optimal policy, which is a set of rules for choosing the best action to take in a given situation to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

Here are the key components of reinforcement learning:

1. Agent: The decision-maker that interacts with the environment, taking actions and observing the outcomes.

2. Environment: The external system in which the agent operates. It provides feedback to the agent in the form of states and rewards.

3. State: A description of the current situation in the environment. It can be a complete or partial representation of the environment's configuration.

4. Action: A decision made by the agent that affects the environment. The set of all possible actions is called the action space.

5. Reward: A scalar value provided by the environment in response to the agent's actions. Rewards indicate the immediate desirability of an action in a particular state.

6. Policy: A strategy followed by the agent to select actions based on the current state. It can be deterministic or stochastic.

7. Value Function: A function that estimates the expected cumulative reward an agent can obtain from a particular state, following a given policy.

The main objective of reinforcement learning is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. This is achieved through a process of exploration and exploitation, where the agent balances between trying new actions to discover their effects and choosing known actions that yield high rewards.

There are various algorithms and techniques in reinforcement learning, such as Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, and Actor-Critic methods, among others. These approaches differ in the way they represent and update the policy, as well as the value function.
