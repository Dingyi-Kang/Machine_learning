## use an example to explain tf.concat(, axis=0)

`tf.concat()` is a TensorFlow function that concatenates tensors along one dimension. 

The `axis` parameter specifies the dimension along which to concatenate. When `axis=0`, the tensors are concatenated along the first dimension. 

Let's go through an example. Suppose we have two tensors:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor1 = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # shape (2, 3)
tensor2 = tf.constant([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])  # shape (2, 3)
```

Each tensor is of shape (2, 3), meaning each one has 2 rows and 3 columns. 

If we concatenate these tensors along the first dimension (`axis=0`), we stack the tensors vertically (adding more rows):

```python
result = tf.concat([tensor1, tensor2], axis=0)

print(result)
```

The output will be:

```
[[ 1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6]
 [ 7  8  9]
 [10 11 12]]
```

As you can see, the result is a new tensor where the rows of `tensor2` are appended to the rows of `tensor1`. The shape of the resulting tensor is (4, 3).
