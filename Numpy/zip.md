## so, we use zip because we want to combine the elements so that we can iterate them in loop?

Yes, exactly. `zip()` is often used when you want to iterate over multiple iterables (like lists or arrays) simultaneously, and perform operations on their corresponding elements. 

For instance, say you have two lists `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6]`, and you want to calculate the element-wise sum. You could do this with a `zip()` function and a loop, like so:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]

for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b):
    print(a_i + b_i)
```

This will print out `5, 7, 9`, which are the sums of the corresponding elements from the two lists.

So, in the context of your machine learning code, using `zip()` allows you to simultaneously iterate over batches of observations, actions, log probabilities, and advantages, and apply the `train_policy` function to each corresponding batch.
