## what is batch size
Batch Size is the number of training examples used in one iteration. The training examples in a batch are processed independently, in parallel. If using GPUs, this parallelism is what makes deep learning computationally feasible.

## what is Epoch
Epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset. Once all training examples have been presented to the network, we've completed one epoch.

## the trade-off when choosing the batch siz
1. **Small Batch Size**:

    Let's say you set the batch size to a very small number, like 1 (This scenario is also known as stochastic gradient descent). 

    Advantages:
    - The model updates weights more frequently, which can lead to faster convergence to a solution.
    - The model requires less memory to process a single batch, which can be advantageous for training on devices with limited memory.
    - It adds some noise to the learning process, which can have a slight regularizing effect, potentially helping the model generalize better to unseen data.

    Disadvantages:
    - The gradient estimate can be poor because it's based on fewer examples, which can cause the learning process to be noisy, i.e., the model's performance might bounce around a lot during training.
    - Smaller batches mean more updates, and more updates mean more time for the training to converge.

2. **Large Batch Size**:

    Let's say you set the batch size equal to the total number of examples in your dataset (This scenario is known as batch gradient descent). 

    Advantages:
    - The model computes the gradient using the entire dataset, so the estimate is accurate, leading to steady convergence.
    - If parallelizable hardware (like GPUs) is available, larger batches can make better use of such hardware's computational capabilities.

    Disadvantages:
    - Large batch sizes require more memory.
    - Less frequent updates can lead to slower convergence.
    - More importantly, the lack of noise in the learning process can lead the model to converge to a sharp minimum that generalizes poorly to unseen data.

**Middle ground: Mini-batch Gradient Descent**

In practice, people usually use a compromise between these two extremes. They choose a batch size in the range of 10-512 (or sometimes larger in the case of extremely large models and datasets). These sizes can balance the trade-offs of memory use, parallelization efficiency, gradient estimate accuracy, and the number of updates per epoch.

In summary, the best batch size often depends on the specific problem and the hardware used for training. It's often chosen via experimentation.
